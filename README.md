# Chalmers MSc Thesis Template

This is a template for master's theses at Chalmers University of Technology,
based on [the template provided by the CSE department][0]. To use it, clone
this repository into a directory named `template`:

```
git clone git@github.com:ayberkt/chalmers-msc-thesis-template.git template
```

Then create your, say `file.tex`, which should look like this:

```
\input{template/template}

This template assumes that you will be using `xelatex/lualatex` (which you
probably should) with the `fontspec` package. It is assumed that you have
system-wide installation of certain fonts: [XITS][1] and XITS Math. You can
override the fonts with `\setmainfont{font-name}` and
`\setmathfont{math-font-name}` although [the official guidelines][2] state that
you should use Times New Roman
